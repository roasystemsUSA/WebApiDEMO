This is an WebAPI demo intended to be an example for the use of the NuGet packages RoaSystems.Libraries.Model, RoaSystems.Libraries.Repositories and RoaSystems.Libraries.Services

You can find these packages at:
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/RoaSystems.Libraries.Model
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/RoaSystems.Libraries.Repositories
- https://www.nuget.org/packages/RoaSystems.Libraries.Services

The appsettings.json file and the credentials.json file are provided in a generic way, substitute with the values you need for your real project. 

This project assumes you already have the following pre-requisites:

- A MySQL database with the tables needed. You will find the corresponding sql file attached.
- A Google Cloud account and a Google Account needed for the permissions we require to send email notifications using Google.
- A ASPSMS.com account, needed for the SMS notifications.
